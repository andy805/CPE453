Assignment 2
lwp

We really got stuck trying to figure out what was happening in the last 
test cases. We failed #24 and #28 , where 24 is where set scheduler
is used and you transfer all the trheads from old scheduler to new 
scheduler. From the diff it looks like we call second->next one last time
as opposed to the reference. we spend alot of time trying to see why it did
it but we ran out of time. I suspect that we are mishandling out lists
somewhere but we couldnt figure out where. we also believe that is the reason
we are also failing the last test case. It says we threw a bogus tid right
from the start. We either wrote our set scheduler wrong or are mishandling
the lists somewhere. 

we included our main and our makefile has extra files we took
from your directoroy. In specific we took that test number 24
to try to debug our lwp. 

As always have mercy
